## üì¶ System Requirements  
Before you begin, make sure your system meets these requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **VHDL Simulator:** GHDL or a compatible VHDL simulator installed on your system.
- **FPGA Development Environment:** Xilinx Vivado or a similar tool for integrating the building blocks into FPGA.

## üîç Features  
This collection includes essential components for digital design:

- **Logic Circuits:** Basic building blocks for creating custom logic.
- **Counters:** Count-up and count-down circuits for various applications.
- **Finite State Machines (FSMs):** Pre-designed states and transitions for complex control tasks.
- **Shift Registers:** Store and shift data for digital processing.
- **FIR Filters:** Implement digital filters to process signals efficiently.
- **DDS/NCO IP Integration:** Direct digital synthesis and numerical controlled oscillators for communications.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage Instructions  
After downloading the files, follow these steps to get started:

1. **Open Your VHDL Simulator:** Launch GHDL or your chosen simulator.
2. **Set Up Your Project:** Create a new project and include the folders where you extracted the downloaded files.
3. **Add Components:** Select the desired design blocks and integrate them into your project.
4. **Simulate Your Design:** Run the simulations to test the performance and functionality of your design.
5. **Deploy on FPGA:** Once satisfied with the design, prepare it for deployment on your FPGA board using Xilinx Vivado or your preferred tool.

## üß™ Testing  
We include testbenches for each component, allowing you to verify their functionality before integrating them into larger projects. Here‚Äôs how to use them:

1. **Locate the Testbench Files:** In the downloaded folder, find the 'testbenches' directory.
2. **Run the Testbench:** Load the provided VHDL testbench in your simulator to initiate automated testing.
3. **Review Results:** Check the output to confirm each component operates as expected.
